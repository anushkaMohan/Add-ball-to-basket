# Add-ball-to-basket
It is a simple program that adds a ball to basket  when a button is clicked for the same. I used this program to learn  some features of jQuery

There are many balls lying on the floor scattered and needs to be put in the basket.
The process is fully automatic and you just need to press a button to initiate the process. After pressing the button, the ball automatically gets stacked in the basket.
The addition of a ball starts from the left side of the basket and gets stacked up as a row gets fully filled.
The balls are picked at random by the machine and they have the following colors - 'red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'lightgrey', 'darkorchid', 'black', 'orange', 'deeppink', 'green', 'purple', 'saddlebrown', 'lightseagreen', 'deepskyblue', 'firebrick' and 'crimson'.
